"\n"
"SYNOPSIS\n"
"       curl [options] [URL...]\n"
"\n"
"DESCRIPTION\n"
"       curl  is  a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the\n"
"       supported protocols (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS,  IMAP,\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       IMAPS,  LDAP,  LDAPS,  POP3,  POP3S,  RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS,\n"
"       SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP). The command is designed to work  without\n"
"       user interaction.\n"
"\n"
"       curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authen-\n"
"       tication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file  trans-\n"
"       fer  resume,  Metalink,  and more. As you will see below, the number of\n"
"       features will make your head spin!\n"
"\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       curl is powered by  libcurl  for  all  transfer-related  features.  See\n"
"       libcurl(3) for details.\n"
"\n"
"URL\n"
"       The  URL  syntax is protocol-dependent. You'll find a detailed descrip-\n"
"       tion in RFC 3986.\n"
"\n"
"       You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs  by  writing  part  sets\n"
"       within braces as in:\n"
"\n"
"         http://site.{one,two,three}.com\n"
"\n"
"       or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:\n"
"\n"
"         ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1-100].txt\n"
"\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"         ftp://ftp.example.com/file[001-100].txt    (with leading zeros)\n"
"\n"
"         ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt\n"
"\n"
"       Nested  sequences  are not supported, but you can use several ones next\n"
"       to each other:\n"
"\n"
"         http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html\n"
"\n"
"       You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line.  They  will  be\n"
"       fetched in a sequential manner in the specified order.\n"
"\n"

"       You  can  specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number\n"

"\n"
"         http://example.com/file[a-z:2].txt\n"
"\n"
"       When using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line  prompt,\n"
"       you probably have to put the full URL within double quotes to avoid the\n"
"       shell from interfering with it. This also  goes  for  other  characters\n"

"       the  amount  of  transferred  data,  transfer speeds and estimated time\n"
"       left, etc. The progress meter displays number of bytes and  the  speeds\n"
"       are  in  bytes per second. The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based.\n"

"       mixing progress meter and response data.\n"
"\n"
"       If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to\n"
"       redirect the response output to a file, using shell  redirect  (>),  -o\n"
"       [file] or similar.\n"
"\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       It  is not the same case for FTP upload as that operation does not spit\n"

"       If you prefer a progress \"bar\" instead of the regular meter, -# is your\n"
"       friend.\n"
"OPTIONS\n"
"       Options  start  with  one or two dashes. Many of the options require an\n"
"       additional value next to them.\n"

"\n"
"       Short version options that don't need any additional values can be used\n"
